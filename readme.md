# Medical Article Summarizer

## Focus

The system is designed to summarize two main types of studies:

- **Observational studies**
- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**

## Evaluation

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using the **ROUGE** metric, which compares the *generated summary* with a *reference summary*.

$$
\text{ROUGE} = \text{Measure of overlap between generated and reference summaries.}
$$
